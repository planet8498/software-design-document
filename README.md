Client and Software Requirements

The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company seeking to expand their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, to multiple platforms. They required a software design that would support a distributed, client-server architecture capable of running across different operating systems. Key requirements included scalability, secure user authentication, efficient memory and storage management, and support for multiple concurrent users while ensuring only one game instance was active at a time.

Strengths in Documentation

One area I performed particularly well in was analyzing and clearly documenting system architecture decisions. I effectively compared operating platforms, memory management techniques, and storage solutions, and then justified my recommendations based on the client’s requirements. I also focused on writing in a way that balanced technical accuracy with clarity, making the document understandable for both technical team members and nontechnical stakeholders.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Process

Working through the design document before coding was extremely helpful because it forced me to think through the system as a whole rather than jumping straight into implementation. Defining requirements, constraints, and architectural choices early helped reduce ambiguity and would make the development phase more efficient and organized. It also highlighted potential issues, such as scalability and concurrency, before they became problems in code.

Areas for Improvement

If I could revise one part of the document, I would improve the level of detail in some of the design constraints and trade-off discussions. While the recommendations were sound, expanding further on alternative solutions and their drawbacks would strengthen the document and provide even more context for future developers working on the system.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by closely aligning system requirements with how players and administrators would interact with the game. This included ensuring responsiveness, reliability, and fair gameplay across platforms. Considering user needs is critical because software ultimately exists to serve its users; a well-designed system that ignores usability or performance expectations can fail even if it is technically correct.

Software Design Approach and Future Strategies

My approach to designing software involved breaking the problem into smaller components, analyzing requirements first, and then selecting appropriate architectural patterns and technologies. In the future, I would continue using techniques such as requirements analysis, UML diagrams, and platform comparisons, while also incorporating more user stories and iterative feedback to further refine designs before implementation.
